## Info:

    This project built by reactjs, html, tailwindcss. there is a firebase database connected to this project to store the requested data from the AI... i used `Rapid-ai` to summarize the text (it's cheap and free of charge for small amount of requests ofc) then i used `axios` to manage the fetching and posting process between the database and the project.
    Please keep in mind that this project is under construction. and it's not the full version of its final shape. hope you understand that when you use.
